# Introduction

I've been playing with (and writing) Leanpub books for a while now, and I kept seeing the same questions asked on the Leanpub author list about formatting text and layout. After writing a bunch of answers and blog entries, I figured that the best way to answer the questions was within a Leanpub book! So here it is. It's certainly not comprehensive (that's what the [Leanpub manual](https://leanpub.com/help/manual) is for), but it does address some of the more "edge" cases that the manual doesn't cover, or where I would've liked more examples. In some cases it showcases bugs or places where the Leanpub manual seems to disagree with the actual output of Leanpub.

A>The examples here are mainly focused on how the PDF output looks, since that's the primary way I read ebooks. I haven't checked the other formats for correctness.
